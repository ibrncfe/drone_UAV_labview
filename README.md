# drone_UAV_labview_LQR
this repository conatins all possible control methods for a UAV multirotor against the disturbances in addition to optimal control systems
the first method is Linear Quadratic Regulator.
the test here is by applying this method on Quadrotor and test the stability and period of flight.
the model is similar to these presented in these articles
